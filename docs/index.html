NAME
       minipeg - parser generator

SYNOPSIS
       minipeg [-hvVP -ooutput] [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       minipeg is a tool for generating recursive-descent parsers: programs
       that perform pattern matching on text.  They process a Parsing
       Expression Grammar (PEG) [Ford 2004] to produce a program that
       recognises legal sentences of that grammar.  minipeg processes PEGs
       written with syntax and conventions that are intended to make it an
       attractive replacement for parsers built with lex(1) and yacc(1).
       Unlike lex and yacc, minipeg support unlimited backtracking, provide
       ordered choice as a means for disambiguation, and can combine scanning
       (lexical analysis) and parsing (syntactic analysis) into a single
       activity.

       minipeg reads the specified filenames, or standard input if no
       filenames are given, for a grammar describing the parser to generate.
       minipeg then generates a C source file that defines a function
       yyparse().  This C source file can be included in, or compiled and then
       linked with, a client program.  Each time the client program calls
       yyparse() the parser consumes input text according to the parsing
       rules, starting from the first rule in the grammar.  yyparse() returns
       non-zero if the input could be parsed according to the grammar; it
       returns zero if the input could not be parsed.

       The prefix 'yy' or 'YY' is prepended to all externally-visible symbols
       in the generated parser.	 This is intended to reduce the risk of
       namespace pollution in client programs.	(The choice of 'yy' is
       historical; see lex(1) and yacc(1), for example.)

OPTIONS
       minipeg provide the following options:

       -h     prints a summary of available options and then exits.

       -ooutput
	      writes the generated parser to the file output instead of the
	      standard output.

       -P     suppresses #line directives in the output.

       -v     writes verbose information to standard error while working.

       -V     writes version information to standard error then exits.

EXAMPLE: A CALCULATOR
       Here we show a simple desk calculator supporting the four common
       arithmetic operators and named variables.  The intermediate results of
       arithmetic evaluation will be accumulated on an implicit stack by
       returning them as semantic values from sub-rules.

	   %{
	   #include <stdio.h>	  /* printf() */
	   #include <stdlib.h>	  /* atoi() */
	   int vars[26];
	   %}

	   Stmt	   = - e:Expr EOL		   { printf("%d\n", e); }
		   | ( !EOL . )* EOL		   { printf("error\n"); }

	   Expr	   = i:ID ASSIGN s:Sum		   { $$ = vars[i] = s; }
		   | s:Sum			   { $$ = s; }

	   Sum	   = l:Product
			   ( PLUS  r:Product	   { l += r; }
			   | MINUS r:Product	   { l -= r; }
			   )*			   { $$ = l; }

	   Product = l:Value
			   ( TIMES  r:Value	   { l *= r; }
			   | DIVIDE r:Value	   { l /= r; }
			   )*			   { $$ = l; }

	   Value   = i:NUMBER			   { $$ = atoi(yytext); }
		   | i:ID !ASSIGN		   { $$ = vars[i]; }
		   | OPEN i:Expr CLOSE		   { $$ = i; }

	   NUMBER  = < [0-9]+ >	   -		   { $$ = atoi(yytext); }
	   ID	   = < [a-z]  >	   -		   { $$ = yytext[0] - 'a'; }
	   ASSIGN  = '='	   -
	   PLUS	   = '+'	   -
	   MINUS   = '-'	   -
	   TIMES   = '*'	   -
	   DIVIDE  = '/'	   -
	   OPEN	   = '('	   -
	   CLOSE   = ')'	   -

	   -	   = [ \t]*
	   EOL	   = '\n' | '\r\n' | '\r' | ';'

	   %%

	   int main()
	   {
	     while (yyparse())
	       ;
	     return 0;
	   }

       If the above grammar is placed in the file calc.peg, running the
       command

	   $ minipeg -o calc.c calc.peg

       will save the corresponding parser in the file calc.c.  The program can
       then be compiled with a C compiler and run

	   $ cc -o calc calc.c
	   $ ./calc
	   a=5
	   5
	   a+5
	   10


MINIPEG GRAMMARS
       A grammar consists of a set of named rules.

	   name = pattern

       The pattern contains one or more of the following elements.

       name   The element stands for the entire pattern in the rule with the
	      given name.

       "characters"
	      A character or string enclosed in double quotes is matched
	      literally.  The ANSI C escape sequences are recognised within
	      the characters.

       'characters'
	      A character or string enclosed in single quotes is matched
	      literally, as above.

       [characters]
	      A set of characters enclosed in square brackets matches any
	      single character from the set, with escape characters recognised
	      as above.	 If the set begins with an uparrow (^) then the set is
	      negated (the element matches any character not in the set).  Any
	      pair of characters separated with a dash (-) represents the
	      range of characters from the first to the second, inclusive.  A
	      single alphabetic character or underscore is matched by the
	      following set.

		  [a-zA-Z_]

	      Similarly, the following matches	any single non-digit
	      character.

		  [^0-9]


       .      A dot matches any character.  Note that the only time this fails
	      is at the end of file, where there is no character to match.

       ( pattern )
	      Parentheses are used for grouping (modifying the precedence of
	      the operators described below).

       { action }
	      Curly braces surround actions.  The action is arbitrary C source
	      code to be executed at the end of matching.  Any braces within
	      the action must be properly nested.  Any input text that was
	      matched before the action and delimited by angle brackets (see
	      below) is made available within the action as the contents of
	      the character array yytext.  The length of (number of characters
	      in) yytext is available in the variable yyleng.  (These variable
	      names are historical; see lex(1).)

       @{ action }
	      Actions prefixed with an 'at' symbol will be performed during
	      parsing, at the time they are encountered while matching the
	      input text with a rule.  Because of back-tracking in the PEG
	      parsing algorithm, actions prefixed with '@' might be performed
	      multiple times for the same input text.  (The usual behviour of
	      actions is that they are saved up until matching is complete,
	      and then those that are part of the final derivation are
	      performed in left-to-right order.)  The variable yytext is
	      available within these actions.

       exp ~ { action }
	      A postfix operator ~{ action } can be placed after any
	      expression and will behave like a normal action (arbitrary C
	      code) except that it is invoked only when exp fails.  It binds
	      less tightly than any other operator except alternation and
	      sequencing, and is intended to make error handling and recovery
	      code easier to write.  Note that yytext and yyleng are not
	      available inside these actions, but the pointer variable yy is
	      available to give the code access to any user-defined members of
	      the parser state (see "CUSTOMISING THE PARSER" below).  Note
	      also that exp is always a single expression; to invoke an error
	      action for any failure within a sequence, parentheses must be
	      used to group the sequence into a single expression.

		  rule = e1 e2 e3 ~{ error("e[12] ok; e3 has failed"); }
		       | ...

		  rule = (e1 e2 e3) ~{ error("one of e[123] has failed"); }
		       | ...

       <      An opening angle bracket always matches (consuming no input) and
	      causes the parser to begin accumulating matched text.  This text
	      will be made available to actions in the variable yytext.

       >      A closing angle bracket always matches (consuming no input) and
	      causes the parser to stop accumulating text for yytext.

       The above elements can be made optional and/or repeatable with the
       following suffixes:

       element ?
	      The element is optional.	If present on the input, it is
	      consumed and the match succeeds.	If not present on the input,
	      no text is consumed and the match succeeds anyway.

       element +
	      The element is repeatable.  If present on the input, one or more
	      occurrences of element are consumed and the match succeeds.  If
	      no occurrences of element are present on the input, the match
	      fails.

       element *
	      The element is optional and repeatable.  If present on the
	      input, one or more occurrences of element are consumed and the
	      match succeeds.  If no occurrences of element are present on the
	      input, the match succeeds anyway.

       The above elements and suffixes can be converted into predicates (that
       match arbitrary input text and subsequently succeed or fail without
       consuming that input) with the following prefixes:

       & element
	      The predicate succeeds only if element can be matched.  Input
	      text scanned while matching element is not consumed from the
	      input and remains available for subsequent matching.

       ! element
	      The predicate succeeds only if element cannot be matched.	 Input
	      text scanned while matching element is not consumed from the
	      input and remains available for subsequent matching.  A popular
	      idiom is

		  !.

	      which matches the end of file, after the last character of the
	      input has already been consumed.

       A special form of the '&' predicate is provided:

       &{ expression }
	      In this predicate the simple C expression (not statement) is
	      evaluated immediately when the parser reaches the predicate.  If
	      the expression yields non-zero (true) the 'match' succeeds and
	      the parser continues with the next element in the pattern.  If
	      the expression yields zero (false) the 'match' fails and the
	      parser backs up to look for an alternative parse of the input.

       Several elements (with or without prefixes and suffixes) can be
       combined into a sequence by writing them one after the other.  The
       entire sequence matches only if each individual element within it
       matches, from left to right.

       Sequences can be separated into disjoint alternatives by the
       alternation operator '|'.

       sequence-1 | sequence-2 | ... | sequence-N
	      Each sequence is tried in turn until one of them matches, at
	      which time matching for the overall pattern succeeds.  If none
	      of the sequences matches then the match of the overall pattern
	      fails.

       The following elements can appear in addition to rules.

       %{ text... %}
	      A declaration section can appear anywhere that a rule definition
	      is expected.  The text between the delimiters '%{' and '%}' is
	      copied verbatim to the generated C parser code before the code
	      that implements the parser itself.

       The pound sign (#) introduces a comment (discarded) that continues
       until the end of the line.

       %% text...
	      A double percent '%%' terminates the rules (and declarations)
	      section of the grammar.  All text following '%%' is copied
	      verbatim to the generated C parser code after the parser
	      implementation code.

       Some notes regarding rules and and patterns follow.

       rule-name Hyphens can appear as letters in the names of rules.  Each
       hyphen is converted into an underscore in the generated C source code.
       A single hyphen '-' is a legal rule name.

       Within actions you can access and manipulate named values.

       $$ = value
	      A sub-rule can return a semantic value from an action by
	      assigning it to the pseudo-variable '$$'.	 All semantic values
	      must have the same type (which defaults to 'int').  This type
	      can be changed by defining YYSTYPE in a declaration section.

       identifier:name
	      The semantic value returned (by assigning to '$$') from the
	      sub-rule name is associated with the identifier and can be
	      referred to in subsequent actions.

	   end-of-line =   '\r\n' | '\n' | '\r'
	   end-of-file =   !.


CUSTOMISING THE PARSER
       The following symbols can be redefined in declaration sections to
       modify the generated parser code.

       YYSTYPE
	      The semantic value type.	The pseudo-variable '$$' and the
	      identifiers 'bound' to rule results with the colon operator ':'
	      should all be considered as being declared to have this type.
	      The default value is 'int'.

       YYPARSE
	      The name of the main entry point to the parser.  The default
	      value is 'yyparse'.

       YYPARSEFROM
	      The name of an alternative entry point to the parser.  This
	      function expects one argument: the function corresponding to the
	      rule from which the search for a match should begin.  The
	      default is 'yyparsefrom'.	 Note that yyparse() is defined as

		  int yyparse() { return yyparsefrom(yy_foo); }

	      where 'foo' is the name of the first rule in the grammar.

       YY_INPUT(buf, result, max_size)
	      This macro is invoked by the parser to obtain more input text.
	      buf points to an area of memory that can hold at most max_size
	      characters.  The macro should copy input text to buf and then
	      assign the integer variable result to indicate the number of
	      characters copied.  If no more input is available, the macro
	      should assign 0 to result.  By default, the YY_INPUT macro is
	      defined as follows.

		  #define YY_INPUT(buf, result, max_size)	 \
		  {						 \
		    int yyc= getchar();				 \
		    result= (EOF == yyc) ? 0 : (*(buf)= yyc, 1); \
		  }

	      Note that if YY_CTX_LOCAL is defined (see below) then an
	      additional first argument, containing the parser context, is
	      passed to YY_INPUT.

       YY_DEBUG
	      If this symbols is defined then additional code will be included
	      in the parser that prints vast quantities of arcane information
	      to the standard error while the parser is running.

       YY_BEGIN
	      This macro is invoked to mark the start of input text that will
	      be made available in actions as 'yytext'.	 This corresponds to
	      occurrences of '<' in the grammar.  These are converted into
	      predicates that are expected to succeed.	The default definition

		  #define YY_BEGIN (yybegin= yypos, 1)

	      therefore saves the current input position and returns 1
	      ('true') as the result of the predicate.

       YY_END This macros corresponds to '>' in the grammar.  Again, it is a
	      predicate so the default definition saves the input position
	      before 'succeeding'.

		  #define YY_END (yyend= yypos, 1)


       YY_PARSE(T)
	      This macro declares the parser entry points (yyparse and
	      yyparsefrom) to be of type T.  The default definition

		  #define YY_PARSE(T) T

	      leaves yyparse() and yyparsefrom() with global visibility.  If
	      they should not be externally visible in other source files,
	      this macro can be redefined to declare them 'static'.

		  #define YY_PARSE(T) static T


       YY_CTX_LOCAL
	      If this symbol is defined during compilation of a generated
	      parser then global parser state will be kept in a structure of
	      type 'yycontext' which can be declared as a local variable.
	      This allows multiple instances of parsers to coexist and to be
	      thread-safe.  The parsing function yyparse() will be declared to
	      expect a first argument of type 'yycontext *', an instance of
	      the structure holding the global state for the parser.  This
	      instance must be allocated and initialised to zero by the
	      client.  A trivial but complete example is as follows.

		  #include <stdio.h>

		  #define YY_CTX_LOCAL

		  #include "the-generated-parser.peg.c"

		  int main()
		  {
		    yycontext ctx;
		    memset(&ctx, 0, sizeof(yycontext));
		    while (yyparse(&ctx));
		    return 0;
		  }

	      Note that if this symbol is undefined then the compiled parser
	      will statically allocate its global state and will be neither
	      reentrant nor thread-safe.  Note also that the parser yycontext
	      structure is initialised automatically the first time yyparse()
	      is called; this structure must therefore be properly initialised
	      to zero before the first call to yyparse().

       YY_CTX_MEMBERS
	      If YY_CTX_LOCAL is defined (see above) then the macro
	      YY_CTX_MEMBERS can be defined to expand to any additional member
	      field declarations that the client would like included in the
	      declaration of the 'yycontext' structure type.  These additional
	      members are otherwise ignored by the generated parser.  The
	      instance of 'yycontext' associated with the currently-active
	      parser is available within actions as the pointer variable yy.

       YY_BUFFER_SIZE
	      The initial size of the text buffer, in bytes.  The default is
	      1024 and the buffer size is doubled whenever required to meet
	      demand during parsing.  An application that typically parses
	      much longer strings could increase this to avoid unnecessary
	      buffer reallocation.

       YY_STACK_SIZE
	      The initial size of the variable and action stacks.  The default
	      is 128, which is doubled whenever required to meet demand during
	      parsing.	Applications that have deep call stacks with many
	      local variables, or that perform many actions after a single
	      successful match, could increase this to avoid unnecessary
	      buffer reallocation.

       YY_MALLOC(YY, SIZE)
	      The memory allocator for all parser-related storage.  The
	      parameters are the current yycontext structure and the number of
	      bytes to allocate.  The default definition is: malloc(SIZE)

       YY_REALLOC(YY, PTR, SIZE)
	      The memory reallocator for dynamically-grown storage (such as
	      text buffers and variable stacks).  The parameters are the
	      current yycontext structure, the previously-allocated storage,
	      and the number of bytes to which that storage should be grown.
	      The default definition is: realloc(PTR, SIZE)

       YY_FREE(YY, PTR)
	      The memory deallocator.  The parameters are the current
	      yycontext structure and the storage to deallocate.  The default
	      definition is: free(PTR)

       YYRELEASE
	      The name of the function that releases all resources held by a
	      yycontext structure.  The default value is 'yyrelease'.

       The following variables can be referred to within actions.

       char *yybuf
	      This variable points to the parser's input buffer used to store
	      input text that has not yet been matched.

       int yypos
	      This is the offset (in yybuf) of the next character to be
	      matched and consumed.

       char *yytext
	      The most recent matched text delimited by '<' and '>' is stored
	      in this variable.

       int yyleng
	      This variable indicates the number of characters in 'yytext'.

       yycontext *yy
	      This variable points to the instance of 'yycontext' associated
	      with the currently-active parser.

       Programs that wish to release all the resources associated with a
       parser can use the following function.

       yyrelease(yycontext*yy)
	      Returns all parser-allocated storage associated with yy to the
	      system.  The storage will be reallocated on the next call to
	      yyparse().

       Note that the storage for the yycontext structure itself is never
       allocated or reclaimed implicitly.  The application must allocate these
       structures in automatic storage, or use calloc() and free() to manage
       them explicitly.	 The example in the following section demonstrates one
       approach to resource management.

EXAMPLE: EXTENDING THE PARSER'S CONTEXT
       The yy variable passed to actions contains the state of the parser plus
       any additional fields defined by YY_CTX_MEMBERS.	 Theses fields can be
       used to store application-specific information that is global to a
       particular call of yyparse().  A trivial but complete leg example
       follows in which the yycontext structure is extended with a count of
       the number of newline characters seen in the input so far (the grammar
       otherwise consumes and ignores the entire input).  The caller of
       yyparse() uses count to print the number of lines of input that were
       read.


	   %{
	   #define YY_CTX_LOCAL 1
	   #define YY_CTX_MEMBERS \
	     int count;
	   %}

	   Char	   = ('\n' | '\r\n' | '\r')	   { yy->count++ }
		   | .

	   %%

	   #include <stdio.h>
	   #include <string.h>

	   int main()
	   {
	       /* create a local parser context in automatic storage */
	       yycontext yy;
	       /* the context *must* be initialised to zero before first use*/
	       memset(&yy, 0, sizeof(yy));

	       while (yyparse(&yy))
		   ;
	       printf("%d newlines\n", yy.count);

	       /* release all resources associated with the context */
	       yyrelease(&yy);

	       return 0;
	   }


DIAGNOSTICS
       minipeg warns about the following conditions while converting a grammar
       into a parser.

       syntax error
	      The input grammar was malformed in some way.  The error message
	      will include the text about to be matched (often backed up a
	      huge amount from the actual location of the error) and the line
	      number of the most recently considered character (which is often
	      the real location of the problem).

       rule 'foo' used but not defined
	      The grammar referred to a rule named 'foo' but no definition for
	      it was given.  Attempting to use the generated parser will
	      likely result in errors from the linker due to undefined symbols
	      associated with the missing rule.

       rule 'foo' defined but not used
	      The grammar defined a rule named 'foo' and then ignored it.  The
	      code associated with the rule is included in the generated
	      parser which will in all other respects be healthy.

       possible infinite left recursion in rule 'foo'
	      There exists at least one path through the grammar that leads
	      from the rule 'foo' back to (a recursive invocation of) the same
	      rule without consuming any input.

       Left recursion, especially that found in standards documents, is often
       'direct' and implies trivial repetition.

	   # (6.7.6)
	   direct-abstract-declarator =
	       LPAREN abstract-declarator RPAREN
	   |   direct-abstract-declarator? LBRACKET assign-expr? RBRACKET
	   |   direct-abstract-declarator? LBRACKET STAR RBRACKET
	   |   direct-abstract-declarator? LPAREN param-type-list? RPAREN

       The recursion can easily be eliminated by converting the parts of the
       pattern following the recursion into a repeatable suffix.

	   # (6.7.6)
	   direct-abstract-declarator =
	       direct-abstract-declarator-head?
	       direct-abstract-declarator-tail*

	   direct-abstract-declarator-head =
	       LPAREN abstract-declarator RPAREN

	   direct-abstract-declarator-tail =
	       LBRACKET assign-expr? RBRACKET
	   |   LBRACKET STAR RBRACKET
	   |   LPAREN param-type-list? RPAREN


CAVEATS
       A parser that accepts empty input will always succeed.  Consider the
       following example, not atypical of a first attempt to write a PEG-based
       parser:

	   Program = Expression*
	   Expression = "whatever"
	   %%
	   int main() {
	     while (yyparse())
	       puts("success!");
	     return 0;
	   }

       This program loops forever, no matter what (if any) input is provided
       on stdin.  Many fixes are possible, the easiest being to insist that
       the parser always consumes some non-empty input.	 Changing the first
       line to

	   Program = Expression+

       accomplishes this.  If the parser is expected to consume the entire
       input, then explicitly requiring the end-of-file is also highly
       recommended:

	   Program = Expression+ !.

       This works because the parser will only fail to match ("!" predicate)
       any character at all ("." expression) when it attempts to read beyond
       the end of the input.

BUGS
       The 'yy' and 'YY' prefixes cannot be changed.

       Left recursion is detected in the input grammar but is not handled
       correctly in the generated parser.

       Diagnostics for errors in the input grammar are obscure and not
       particularly helpful.

       The operators ! and ~ should really be named the other way around.

       Several commonly-used lex(1) features (yywrap(), yyin, etc.) are
       completely absent.

       The generated parser does not contain '#line' directives to direct C
       compiler errors back to the grammar description when appropriate.
